In our project, we attempt to learn how quickly APs decay to the corresponding AP thresholds for different cells. AP threshold of a certain cell is defined as the average AP threshold throughout the spike-train. We compute the durations between the peak and the first occurrence of the AP threshold after that peak, the average of which is the repolarisation period of each cell. We recognise that using average AP thresholds does not account for short-term plasticity, but for a rough comparison of repolarisation periods for different cells the average AP thresholds suffices.
